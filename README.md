Angler is my first AngularJS project. Currently in its demo phase, it is simply a fully front-end image gallery application. I included dummy images in a folder, whose sources are getting pulled in via JSON in the main app.js file. You can open any thumbnails in a lightbox and browse through them chronologically in the lightbox. The gallery is responsive, so it will format to whichever device you are using. I used a small homegrown library of vanilla JS functions to tighten up the UI, but most of the orientation and styles were accomplished with CSS (compiled from LESS).

Again, this is still in demo-land, and I plan to move the image info to an external file or database for easier maintainability. I also plan on adding a form for adding new images to the gallery.
